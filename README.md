# Anikuaa Yvy

This is my first game created from scratch!  
Its idea is to apply what I'm learning with Python and have fun while exploring differents possibilities with this amazing tool. <br/>

Also, I wanted to introduce the art of coding to my little brother. So I decided to create a game in which he could play and code with me, having ideas about the story and changing the gameplay in a way that is more exiting to the player. <br/>

Anykuaa Yvy - "Unknown Land" in Tupi Guarani - is a text RPG based in D&D, and The Lord of the Rings. If you liked the idea please help me! I don't have much time to work on it since new projects are always coming to my mind.

So lets code and keep creative!
