# Anikuaa Yvy

Hello World!

This is my first game created from scratch!
Its idea is to practice my code having fun and to introduce the art of coding to my little brother;
Anykuaa Yvy - "Unknown Land" in Tupi Guarani - is a text RPG based in D&D, The Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars.
If you liked the idea please help me! I don't have much time to work on it and new ideas are always welcome!
